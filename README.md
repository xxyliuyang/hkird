Given the current stage where large-scale models have extensive parameters, there's a need for significant hardware support, such as GPUs like the A100 and V100. A singular evaluation on my part might lack objectivity. Therefore, I suggest using https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/CLEVA to demonstrate the performance of Chinese large-scale models on Chinese datasets. Although this doesn't specifically address the insurance industry, it provides a comprehensive display of the model's foundational capabilities across various dimensions. For the model to perform optimally in the insurance sector, domain-specific data and fine-tuning (sft) would be essential to enhance its commercial usability. Hence, I've not attached an evaluation in the form of an IPython notebook. If there's a need for a basic evaluation of the Chinese model, please get in touch with me.
